# Project Name: Shoe Inventory Management

## Description:
The Shoe Inventory Management project is a web application developed using the Flask framework to facilitate the management of shoe inventory. The application utilizes HTML pages as templates for the user interface and connects to a MongoDB local server as the database backend. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the inventory items, allowing for efficient management of shoe products. Additionally, the application features a "Summary" button, which leverages an aggregate pipeline to generate and display a summary of the inventory.

## The Application:
Upon accessing the application, you will be presented with a user-friendly interface to manage the shoe inventory.
Perform CRUD operations on the inventory items, including adding new items, viewing existing items, updating item details, and deleting items as needed.
Click on the "Summary" button to generate a summary of the inventory using an aggregate pipeline, providing valuable insights into the inventory status.
